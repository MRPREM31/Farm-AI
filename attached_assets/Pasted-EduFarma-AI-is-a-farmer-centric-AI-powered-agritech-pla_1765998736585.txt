EduFarma AI is a farmer-centric, AI-powered agritech platform designed to make agricultural knowledge simple, accessible, and actionable for farmers, especially in rural areas. The platform allows farmers to describe crop problems in their own words (such as leaf fungus, white powder on leaves, yellow spots, or pest damage), and intelligently analyzes the symptoms using advanced AI reasoning powered by the Groq Large Language Model (LLM). Based on the farmer’s description, EduFarma AI identifies the most likely crop disease or issue, explains why the problem occurs, and provides clear, step-by-step guidance on recommended medicines, treatment methods, and basic prevention tips in simple Hindi or English.

The system is designed with no login requirement, ensuring ease of use for all farmers, even those with limited digital literacy. In addition to text-based diagnosis, EduFarma AI enhances understanding through a Hindi voice assistant that reads out the diagnosis and medicine recommendations, helping farmers who may have reading difficulties. Each diagnosis can be automatically converted into a downloadable PDF report, allowing farmers to save, share, or print the information for offline reference. The platform also supports QR-based scan history, enabling farmers to revisit previous diagnoses easily without creating an account.

Beyond diagnosis, EduFarma AI includes a gamified learning module that offers offline-friendly farming courses and quizzes, helping farmers learn best practices in a fun and engaging way while earning points and progress levels. A weather-based alert system further supports decision-making by providing basic climate insights to avoid actions such as spraying before rainfall. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend and Python Flask for the backend, EduFarma AI focuses on reliability, simplicity, multilingual support, and real-world usability. The project demonstrates how AI can be responsibly applied in agriculture to empower farmers with timely knowledge, reduce crop loss, and promote sustainable farming practices.
